# More columns in applications view

This is a GNOME Shell extension to set the max number of columns in the "applications grid" view (by default, this maximum is only 6).

The actual number of columns is **still computed the same way, depending on your screen aspect ratio:** there are 4 lines, and icons are square, so no magic possible.

Usually with a 16:9 aspect ratio, you can have 8 columns (see screenshot). With a 4:3 aspect ratio, the extension has no effect.

Compatible with GNOME Shell 3.18 to 3.36

After the installation, you need to restart GNOME Shell ("logout and login again", or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>, `r`, <kbd>Enter</kbd>).

You can get it from [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1305/more-columns-in-applications-view/)

Arch Linux users can install `gnome-shell-extension-more-columns-in-applications-view-git` from AUR.

(I don't maintain that package, i've no idea if it's up-to-date).
