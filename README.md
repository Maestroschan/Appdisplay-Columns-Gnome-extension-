# Appdisplay's Columns (Gnome extension)
Set the number of columns in the "applications" view (by default, the maximum is only 6)

## Installation

> How to install the extension ?

It's not on the official website yet so you have to do it manually :

Download files and put them in an `appdisplay-personalization@maestroschan.fr` folder created into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again", or alt+f2 + r + enter).
