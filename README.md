## Appdisplay's Columns (Gnome extension)
Set the number of columns in the "applications" view (by default, the maximum is only 6)

This is an incomplete draft which has been merged in the code of this other project : https://github.com/Maestroschan/appfolders-manager-gnome-extension

### Installation

> How to install the extension ?

It's not on the official website so you have to install it manually :

Download files and put them in an `appdisplay-personalization@maestroschan.fr` folder created into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again", or alt+f2 + r + enter).
